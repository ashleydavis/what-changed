# Points git at the repository's checked-in hooks, once per clone.
#
# Git does not use a checked-in hooks directory on its own: it only ever runs what is in the clone's
# own hooks directory, which is not version controlled. Setting core.hooksPath is what makes .githooks
# live, and it is per-clone configuration, so every clone (and anyone who has already cloned) has to
# run this. Nothing runs it automatically.
#
# The path is set relative, not absolute, so it resolves against whichever working tree git is running
# in. That is what makes the hooks work in a git worktree as well as the main clone, since the two
# share one config file.
